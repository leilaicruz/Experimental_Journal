# Title : 11072019-ylic132-1 and ylic132-2  transformation with the OEP2 :white_check_mark:

# Date
11072019

# Objective
To kickout the ura3 gene from the ade2 locus

# Method and procedure
- I inoculated 100ml of cells of both strains on Monday 08072019
- On Wednesday morning (10072019) I diluted the saturated cultures 10^5x times, 1ul in 100ml YPD.
- Next morning, 11072019, strangely, ylic132_1 was really dense with OD of 16 and ylic132_2 not dense at all, with OD=0.6 ü§î
- I diluted ylic132_1 , 80x to approximately OD of 0.2 and I didnt dilute ylic132_2, just add 2x ADE, which means 200ul of 1000x concentrated stock to a 100ml culture.
- I had diluted again ylic132_2 50x because at 11:30 it was close to OD=1,2, so it seems the adenine speed up the growth. While ylic132_1 was just 0.252 , so I added 200ul 1000x ade to the culture.
- at 13:15 the OD was 1.38 for ylic132_2 and 0.9 for ylic132_1.
- after centrifugation **I realized ylic132_1 was contaminated** üò¨ üò© because the supernatant was not completely clean as ylic132_2 and the pellet was kind of yellowish.
- I used for all centrfugation steps 600g and 5 secs , and also I minimize the time in LiAc 0.1M.
- I pipette in and out after adding every component  of the transformation mix , NO VORTEX ‚ò†Ô∏è
## Homology arms:
* left homology arm: 252 bp
  > PCR of primer_1_new_upstream_forward and primer_7_upstream
* right homology arm: 271 bp
  > PCR of primer_6_new_downstream_reverse_NO_Rga1 and primer_8_downstream



## DNA concentration
 I used 10ul of 336.8ng/ul OEP2 , so 3.36ug of DNA

## Recovery Step - Essential for plating in selective 5FOA plates

In order to use the two options for recovery, namely, previous 2-4 hours incubation in 1ml YPD and then plating in 5FOA plates , and plating 200ul in YPD plates and incubating the rest in 30C overnight for plating on the next morning , and the ones in the YPD plate do replicate plating in 5FOA on next morning. I did:

- After removing the transformation mix , resuspend the cells in 1mL YPD
- Split 500ul to a new eppi, to have two eppies per recovery options
- Add 500ul YPD to each eppi
- Take 200ul for one of them and plate in YPD+3xade (60ul ade 1000x)
- The rest ,2 tubes for  ylic132_2+OEP2 and 2 tubes for negative control of ylic132_2 , are left in the 30C incubator, from 3:15pm.
- At 5:30pm I took one of each tube and plate in 5FOA (I only have 3 5FOA plates.. so I think I can only plate the transformed cells 1mL) I need exactly 3 plates : one for after incubation, one for replica plate , and the other one for plating the rest of the overnight culture.
- Next morning, I replica plated the YPD plate with a cell loan onto a 5FOA +3xade plate.
- Plated from the overnight recovery culture of ylic132_2+OEP2, 800ul onto a new 5FOA +3x ade plate, to increase the chances of getting the right transformants.
- Plate 800ul of ylic132_2 negative control onto another 5FOA+3xade I found in the 4C fridge.
- Wait until 15072019, Monday, for the formation of colonies üôè

## Selection plates
- **5FOA plates + 3x ADE** , in which only cells lacking URA3 are capable of grow. (positive control for the transformed cells)


# Results -> I see colonies in 5FOA üòÅ

#### Overnight recovery in liquid culture

#### Replica plate from overnight YPD plate to 5FOA

#### 3 hours recovery (one colony)
![](../images/3h-recovery-5foa.jpg)
#### Negative control - after overnight culture in YPD

# Next steps
- [x] Colony PCR

    - 12 colonies in total: 5 from the overnight recovery, 4 from replica plating , the one from 3h recovery and 2 from the negative control.
    - Dissolving in 20ul MiliQ and replated in YPD
    - Using primers 22 (Primer 9 ADE Forward Check) and primers 23 (Primer 10 Reverse Check)
- [x] DNA Gel to see check bands according URA presence or not. Length for not presence 1046bp and otherwise 2065bp. IT SEEMS I HAVE SOME RIGHT COLONIES üòÅüòÅ

# Conclusion
 - Definitely, the recovery step is essential to get transformed cells in 5FOA plates
 - Now I dont see , this egg like structure of the yellow cells concentrated in the center and pink cells around. I dropped the extra adenine at the edge of the plate, and not dropping in the center.
 - The most efficient one is the overnight recovery in liquid culture, in terms of amount of colonies.
 # Next steps:
 - Plating 8 colonies in -ade and -ura to check that they dont grow.
 - Overnight grow in liquid culture 1-5 for genomic prep.
 - [Genomic Prep of 5 biological replicates](./2019-07-17_Exp-Genomic-prep-ylic133-clones.md)
 - PCR with primer 22 and primer 23
 - Gel to check backgrounds
 - Sequencing to see that the URA is not there.
