# Title : Transformation of ylic133 (WT ade- ura-) with pbK549 for SATAY

## Date
15072020

## Objective
- To integrate the WT in the SATAY round with ylic135 and ylic136

## Method
- Yeast Transformation Protocol

- 15072020: Incubation from glycerol stock in 10ml YPD+6xade
- 16072020: OD measurement : 11.3 at 9:35 am , so I did 20X dilution of the original culture to have around OD=0.5
  - Transformation stopped 
- 23072020 **Re-do of the transformation**
  - at 9:35am OD measurement, OD=~6 , I diluted 10x times to a final volume of 10mL with YPD+6xade
  - at 11:55am OD measurement, OD=1,8 :) So , the cells were ready for transformation. 

- 3ul plasmid (46,7ng/ul) implies 140ng plasmid.
- I did one negative controls. 
- Plating 150ul cells+50ul MiliQ and 50ul cells+150ul MiliQ in -URA+6xADE and 200ul cells of the negative control in -URA+6xade

### Sanity check

- [x] 07082020- Plate 12 colonies of ylic133+pBk549 for the sanity check
- Colony #10 and #12 passed the test

## Results

- I have plenty of colonies in the transformation plate :)
- None from the negative control. :)
- Proceed with these two colonies for SATAY
