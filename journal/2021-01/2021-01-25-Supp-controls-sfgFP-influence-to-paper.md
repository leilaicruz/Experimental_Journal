## Date
25012021-

- Strains:

- Measure in 0,0.06% and 0.1% Galactose concentrations in 36C , using two technical replicates per plate . (If possible do two plates)
- Booking of the plate reader Biotek on 10022021
  - [x] Incubation on 08022021
  - [x] Layout modified in the moment (because a pipette mistake):

  - [x] Experiment started at 11:30 
    - [x] Linear 3 mins:30 secs and  orbital 3 mins:30 secs shaking before each measurement at 36C
  

### Protocol

- Growth assay protocol (p.66 Werner PhD Thesis)
  - First, a 96 well plate is inoculated with about 5 μl of cells into 100 μl medium per well in a predefined layout. In addition, sterile MiliQ is put in the four reservoirs in the perimeter (4 times 2 mL) and 77 times 100 μl in the reservoirs between wells. The wells are then covered by a sticker and with the lid on, it is placed shaking slowly (100-150 rpm) for 2 days at 30 ºC..
  - Then, using a multi-pipette, 10 μl of cells of this plate are transferred to a new plate which has 90 μl of media in the same layout, which dilutes the cells a factor of ten. This is then repeated for a new plate, where 5 μl of cells are transferred to 95 μl media, to ultimately accomplish a 200x dilution compared to the original plate. When making the dilution, wells are gently mixed before dilution by pipetting up and down. The 200x diluted plate is then sealed by a transparent sticker, and covered with the lid to minimize evaporation (and water is placed in the reservoirs as before).
- Measurement protocol:
  - The first 1000s linearly pre-shakes (amplitude 1 mm) the plate, before shaking just before each measurement round in a 380 second interval. These rounds start with 90” linear shaking (amplitude 2 mm), 90” orbital shaking (amplitude 1.5 mm), 90” linear shaking (amplitude 1 mm), waiting 10” and then OD-600 +/-9 nm measurements (25 flashes, 5ms settle time). Rounds were executed in two consecutive loops of 24 hours, after which OD values were documented in a excel sheet.

- Observations from the incubation 
  - 2uL of melted glycerol stocks per well
  - started at 10:30
  - Media base: 4xCSM-NF+2%Raff
  - ![Screenshot of the incubation after 48h](../images/19022021-screenshot-incubation-curves.png)
 
- Measuring at 36C at 11:00
  - 1uL of cells from incubation to 100uL media (easier to pipette)~100X dilution

### Checking the strains from the glycerol stocks

#### Plating all glycerol stocks in selection media 

- Plates: 
  - CSM-URA +2% Raffinose + G418(for dbem1) + NAT(for dbem1dbem3)(for the plates , I autoclaved the agar with MiliQ and then added the SC-URA mixture with the sugar, one note here is that I added the SC-URA without filter sterilize to the 80C liquid agar.)
  - Results of the plating(the plates do not seem to be contaminated):

#### Inoculating all glycerol stocks in selection media 

- To mimic biotek conditions and se if there is a contamination on the stocks , I will :
  - [x] Inoculate the cells to liquid media CSM-URA+2% Raffinose 
  - [ ] Streak from the liquid culture to a plate of the same kind.

## Conclusion
- Unexpected growth of the pGal1 strains in 0% Gal from the bulk growth in the Biotek.
- The phenotype check on liquid and solid media are consistent between each other.
- What is striking is that ywkd062 did grow on SC-URA and it should not be because it is just a plain WT strain. 
- Maybe for next biotek experiment we should incubate the cells in SC-URA media.
