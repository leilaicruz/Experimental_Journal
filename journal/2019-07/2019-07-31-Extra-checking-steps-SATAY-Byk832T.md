# Title: 2019-07-31 Double check Byk832T biolog.  replicates suitability for SATAY.

# Date
Wednesday, 31072019

# Objective
To be sure that the strains we are using, which are the Byk832 + pBK549, are the correct one to start the SATAY.

Essentially , they have to fulfill two main requirements:
- Full growth in SD-URA
- Few growth in SD-ADE

# Method
- Re-streaking from the glycerol stocks of each of the strains onto -ura and - ade plates.

# Results

1st line of plates : -URA plates

2nd line of plates: -ade plates

# Conclusion

- We can observe prominent growth in the -ade plates, indicating our transformed strains are not the ideal strains to continue with the SATAY.
- We should transform them again with pBK549 and also transform another strain like yll3a with that plasmid , and compare both of them.
