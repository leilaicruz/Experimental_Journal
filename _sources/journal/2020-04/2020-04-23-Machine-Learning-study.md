# Title: 23042020-Summary on machine learning study 

## Date:
23042020

## Goal:

1. To get acquainted with machine and statiscal learning in order to use it as a tool to generate meaningful hypothesis for the project, for example, whether two genes are synthetic lethals or not. 

2. To get an understanding of the workflow when applying machine learning to biology and bioinformatics.

### Method:

- Replicating existing examples from papers
- Taking courses on statistica learning

### Results: 

- The implementation of this project is in this github repo : [machine-learning-for-yeast](https://github.com/leilaicruz/machine-learning-for-yeast/tree/dev_Leila)

  - The repo has a [project board](https://github.com/leilaicruz/machine-learning-for-yeast/projects/1) where we organize the work on ```To do's``` , ```In progress``` and ```Done``` tasks. 
  - The repo is under an [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

   - The collaborators of the repo are, so far:

      - github-username: EKingma
      - github-username: cseale
      - github-username: Gregory94
      - github-username: Wteunisse

- In order to be educated on the topic , I am following an EdX course , recommended by [Joana Gonzalvez](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/the-delft-bioinformatics-lab/people/joana-goncalves/), our potential collaborator from EWI, TU Delft. 
- The course is entitled: "Statistical learning" StanfordOnline: STATSX0001

## Next Steps:

- **Educational related:**
  - To take also a EdX course allowed by TU Delft to get a free certificate:  *Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments* 

- **More projects:**

  - Use other features including go-terms and pathway information for example to also predict synthetic lethality.
