# Title:14012020-Mapping essential genes  in WT and getting insights from it.

## Date
14012020

## Objective
To analyze and get some insights from the essential genes in WT.
Useful questions:

- How many essential genes in WT are also bem1 interactors?
- How many essential genes in WT are also bem1 synthetic lethals?
- What is the dependency of the number of synthetic lethals of specif gene with the fitness of a knockout cell from that gene.

## Method

- I mainly used for this analysis the software [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) under an academic license, for free.
- This software is handy to quickly inspect a difficult dataset with many dimensions and variables.

## Results
- The list of essential genes I downloaded from [Here](http://www.essentialgene.org/). Essentially it consists of 1110 genes , around 20% of yeast genome , measured in rich media for *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.
  - The reference of the study is [this paper from 2002](Giaever G, et al (2002). Functional profiling of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Nature, 418:387-91.), called: *Functional profiling of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome*.

- How many essential genes in WT are also bem1 interactors?

34 genes out of 321 bem1 interactors genes are also essential in WT.
This represents the 3% of all essential genes in WT interacts with Bem1.

- Bem1 synthetic lethals mapping -38 genes

- How many bem1 synthetic lethals are also essential genes in WT?

Insight 1: Out of the 34 essential genes that intersect with Bem1 interactors, 13 are Bem1 synthetic lethals (~ 1/3 of them ). ***This means that at least 21 essential genes in WT looses their essentiality in dbem1 background***.

Insight 2: 13 genes out of 38 bem1 synthetic lethals are also WT essential genes (~ 1/3 of them). ***This means  that 25 synthetic lethals genes of bem1 have gained essentiality in this background***.

## Conclusion

-  Most of the genes that are essential in WT are not synthetic lethals of Bem1.
    -  Is this because they can not be included in the SGA assay? hence they could never pop up because they were never measured...
    -  Following this logic , how can we explained the ones are conserved? this 1% of genes, which includes: cdc42, cdc24 and cdc28. 

## Notes
 It is important to note that the synthetic lethals were measured with a subset of nonessential genes from WT.


From " *A. Baryshnikova et al., “Chapter 7 - Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) Analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.*”" :

> This chapter focuses on ***the application ofSGA analysis to generate double mutant strains and identify genetic interactions among nonessential deletion mutants***.

> However, SGA can also be applied to examine synthetic genetic interactions involving essential genes. For example, ***an SGA query strain can be crossed to the Tet-promoter collection (yTHC, Open Biosystems), double mutants can be selected and scored for growth defects in the presence of doxycycline, which downregulates the expression ofthe essential genes*** (Davierwala et al., 2005). Other essential gene mutant collections (Ben-Aroya et al., 2008; Schuldiner et al., 2005) are now available in arrayed formats and are amenable to genetic interaction analyses using SGA technology (Costanzo et al., in press).
