# Title: 14062019-ylic132  transformation with the OEP2 (unsuccesful)  :x: :disappointed:

## Date
14062019
## Objective
To remove the ura3 gene from ylic132= ade2- ura3+ by inserting an empty sequence in the ade2 locus , where the ura3 gene is in ylic132.

## Method
[Yeast transformation protocol](C:\Users\linigodelacruz\Documents\PhD_2018\Documentation\SATAY\URA_transformation_in_the_ADE_locus_032019\Protocol_PCR.pdf)

 > I used in this case 10ml of overnight culture instead of 150 ml as the protocol points out. Then I used the lithium acetate volume (to a final volume of 500ul) that is indicated for 100ml of diluetd culture, so **my cells were were really diluted** , because I started with 10mL, so I should have used lithium acetate for a final volume of 50ul. 10ml is for **just one transformation**.  This could be why it went wrong.

### Homology arms:
* left homology arm: 252 bp
  > PCR of primer_1_new_upstream_forward and primer_7_upstream
* right homology arm: 271 bp
  > PCR of primer_6_new_downstream_reverse_NO_Rga1 and primer_8_downstream

### DNA concentration
7ul of 600 ng/ul OEP2 = 4.2 ug

### Selection plates
- **-URA + 3x ADE** (for ylic132 positive control- no transformed cells ) and for the transformed cells as a negative control
- **5FOA plates + 3x ADE** , in which only cells lacking URA3 are capable of grow. (positive control for the transformed cells)

## Results
**No growth in 5FOA plates on 17062019** ðŸ˜•

> The reason could be that I made the protocol using the same amount of lithium acetate for a volume of 50ml instead of 10ml, meaning that my cells were very diluted for transformation, so I decreased in several order of magnituds the titer of the cells.

**Patterned growth of pink and lighter colonies in the -URA +3xADe2 plates**

> Actually it was a gradient of adenine when I dropped the adenine. After some days that spot became pink :)

## Next steps

- [x] Prepare more OEP2 to have more concentration to transform. (19062019)
- [ ] Repeat the transformation.
