# Title : bem1::KanMX transformation in WT+pGal-CDC42

## Date

06042021- 

## Objective

-  To have this strain for the growth controls measurements needed for the paper with Fridtjof. 
- The strain we had yIdb005a,b are completely contaminated with WT. See the last results from [2021-01-25-Supp-controls-sfgFP-influence-to-paper](../2021-01/2021-01-25-Supp-controls-sfgFP-influence-to-paper.md)

## Method

- Yeast Transformation Protocol
- 06042021: Incubation of ywkd071a in SC-URA+2%Gal+2% Raff 
- 07042021: Culture not in log phase, only at late afternoon , around 15:00. I transfered the culture to room temperature to do the transformation on the next day. 
- 08042021: OD measurement

| strain   | OD 10x dilution | Real OD | Dilution to OD=0.5  | Real OD after dilution |
|----------|-----------------|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| ywkd071a | 0.7             | ~7      | 10x                 | 0.4                    |

  - Incubation started at 9:00 

  - Start of transformation at 13:00 , with OD=1.3
  - 10ul of DNA from PCR bem1:KANmx (~200ng/uL) = 2ug DNA
  - 2h recovery step in SC-URA+2% Gal+2% Raff
  - Plate in selection plates (Sc-URA+2%gal+2%raff +G418)
    - 100ul 0x dilution (positive control) 
    - 100ul 50x dilution (positive control)  
    - 100ul 100X dilution (positive control)
    - 100uL 0X dilution (negative control) 
  - Plate in normal plates (SC-URA+2%gal+2%raff )
    - 100uL 100X dilution (positive control) 
    - 100uL 100X dilution (negative control)
