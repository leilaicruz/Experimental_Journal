# Title : Design of the genomic transformation to make dnrp1 and dbem2 strains usable for SATAY

## Date
09022020

## Objective
- To design an strategy to make the following strains, in order to test SATAy on them :
  - $\Delta nrp1$ *ura3-* *ade2-*
  - $\Delta bem2$ *ura3-* *ade2-*

## Method

- The strategy is to delete *nrp1* using the HYGRO cassette and *bem2* in the leu2 locus as Liedewij has in her strains, in my ylic133 strain.
- The procedure consists on:
  - Extract the genomic DNA of ylic133 and 
-
