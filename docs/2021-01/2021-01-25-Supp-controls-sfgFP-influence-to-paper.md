# Title: Supp controls on sfgFP influence on the bulk growth

## Date
25012021-

## Objective

- To discard the influence of the sfGFP on the Cdc42 dependency for growth
- 
## Method

- Strains:

- Measure in 0,0.06% and 0.1% Galactose concentrations in 36C , using two technical replicates per plate . (If possible do two plates)

### Protocol

- Growth assay protocol (p.66 Werner PhD Thesis)
  - First, a 96 well plate is inoculated with about 5 μl of cells into 100 μl medium per well in a predefined layout. In addition, sterile MiliQ is put in the four reservoirs in the perimeter (4 times 2 mL) and 77 times 100 μl in the reservoirs between wells. The wells are then covered by a sticker and with the lid on, it is placed shaking slowly (100-150 rpm) for 2 days at 30 ºC..
  - Then, using a multi-pipette, 10 μl of cells of this plate are transferred to a new plate which has 90 μl of media in the same layout, which dilutes the cells a factor of ten. This is then repeated for a new plate, where 5 μl of cells are transferred to 95 μl media, to ultimately accomplish a 200x dilution compared to the original plate. When making the dilution, wells are gently mixed before dilution by pipetting up and down. The 200x diluted plate is then sealed by a transparent sticker, and covered with the lid to minimize evaporation (and water is placed in the reservoirs as before).
- Measurement protocol:
  - The first 1000s linearly pre-shakes (amplitude 1 mm) the plate, before shaking just before each measurement round in a 380 second interval. These rounds start with 90” linear shaking (amplitude 2 mm), 90” orbital shaking (amplitude 1.5 mm), 90” linear shaking (amplitude 1 mm), waiting 10” and then OD-600 +/-9 nm measurements (25 flashes, 5ms settle time). Rounds were executed in two consecutive loops of 24 hours, after which OD values were documented in a excel sheet.
