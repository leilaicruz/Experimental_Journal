# Title : 12092019-Transformation of yli133 with the pLL112 plasmid

# Date
12092019-
# Objective
To mark temporarily ylic133 in order to be able to select for diploids after the mating with yEK7a.

# Method
- Plasmid transformation using pLL112: pRS416 (URA3 CEN6_ARSH4)
- 12092019: Incubation of ylic133_2 in 10mL YP+2% Dextrose
- 13092019: OD measurements @9:30am

  |   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Dilution factor to OD=0.5   |Time|
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | ylic133_2  |0.259   | 2.6  | 5.2  | @9:30am |
- 2h after the 5x dilution of the dense culture in 10mL YPD
  |   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Time|
  |---|---|---|---|
  | ylic133_2  |0.126   | 1.3  | @11:30am|
- 5ul of pLL112 plasmid , which has 2290ng/mL
