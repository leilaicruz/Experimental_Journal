## Date:
26062019

## Objective:
To check if the transformation with the URA3+ promoter with ade2 flanking regions was indeed what we expect according the selective growth on -URA plates and the pink phenotype of lacking the adenine.

## Method

I use primers 24 and primer 26 to do the PCR on the genomic DNA of ylic132 to send for sequencing.

> primer 24: ATTACAGCTATGCTGACAAATGACTCTTG

> primer 26: GCTATCCTCGGTTCTGCATTGAGC


## Results

## Conclusion

- point mutation of a 'C' instead of a 'T' in the ura promoter, however, it does not seem to cause any affect.
- I will do sequencing of 7 more biological replicates of ylic132 to compare with this one.
