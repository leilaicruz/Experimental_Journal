# Title : bem1::KanMX transformation in WT+pGal-CDC42

## Date

06042021- 

## Objective

-  To have this strain for the growth controls measurements needed for the paper with Fridtjof. 
- The strain we had yIdb005a,b are completely contaminated with WT. See the last results from [2021-01-25-Supp-controls-sfgFP-influence-to-paper](../2021-01/2021-01-25-Supp-controls-sfgFP-influence-to-paper.md)

## Method

- Yeast Transformation Protocol
- 06042021: Incubation of ywkd071a in SC-URA+2%Gal+2% Raff 
- 07042021: Culture not in log phase, only at late afternoon , around 15:00. I transfered the culture to room temperature to do the transformation on the next day.
