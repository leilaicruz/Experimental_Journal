# Title : 14012020- Next-FACS planing-upon the insights on the GAL1 promoter

## Date
14012020

Next experiment date:

## Objective
To set up a consistent FACs experiment with the microscopy experiments I did with Werner strains containing the Gal1p-Cdc42-sfGFP.

## Method
- Insights from the Gal1 promoter
  - The location in the genome at which the gal promoter was inserted can have a strong effect on the expression pattern of the gal promoter (*Ramon feedback*). Hence we should not compare different studies of the Gal1 promoter with ours if the integration in the genome is in a different location and also if it is a plasmid or not.
  - We should compare systematically the Gal1p expression pattern of the strains that has the sfGFP (Werner strains) and the mneonGreen ones (Ramon/Miranda strains), because they have the same type of genomic integration of the Gal1 promoter.

    - [ ] **Ask Reza for his data with WT+mneongreen to comapre with mine**
- Follow the same protocol as I followed for the microscopy measurements

![Experimental Design for the microscopy measurements](../images/experimental-design-microscopy.png){#fig:experimental-design}

  - 15 hours of incubation in 2% Gal +2% Raff (i.e. overnight incubation from 17:00 to 08:00 )
  - Washing step  with CSM+2% Raff+0%Gal to the respective Galactose (at 08:00-09:00) concentrations. Incubate
  - Measure FACs after 24 hours of incubation . (next day of the washing step)
    - Use the references cdc42-GFP ywkd038 and ywkd001 in  2% dextrose +2% Raff, in CSM-met and CSM respectively.
