# Title : Preparation for PCR check of BEM2 presence and absence in strain ylic135

## Date
07062020-

## Objective

- [ ] Repeat the test done on [beginning of May](../2020-04/2020-04-30-Checking-bem2-deletion-on-ylic133_5.md) to see if I get something usable...
- [ ] Check the presence of the leu2 marker in the position of bem2 gene , and checking the bem2 absence in the mutants strains. 

## Method

- Colony PCR with freshly grown cells from glycerol stocks.  
![Sketch of what is expected in the colony PCR](../images/30042020-cartoon-pcr-ylic133_5.png){#fig:sketch-pcr}

- 06072020 
    - 10:00am Plate all glycerol stocks of ylic135 in -leu2 plates , and in YPD 
- 07062020
    - No growth yet in -leu2 plates . 
    - Pink colonies in YPD
- 08072020
    - Colony PCR at 10:30am - 12:30pm.
    - Protocol "Leila"
    - 5ul Template
    - Primers 49 y 50 
    - I added 1ul of DNA template from yll3a as a positive control for Bem2 presence, with primers 47 y 48. 

## Important Note!!!!!!!!
- THESE PCR WOULD NEVER WORKS BECAUSE THE PRIMER SET TAKEN FOR EACH TEST WAS WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!
- I was taking only the pink or the blues primer set, looking at the picture above, hence I would never get a band and the region tested was completely wrong!!!
- The right primer set combination  is: 
    - 41/49 and 50/42 primer set to test the presence of leu2 marker in the mutants. So 2 PCR per strain. 
    - 41/47 and 48/42 primer set to test the presence of BEM2 in the WT. 
- For 5 biological replicates there are 10 PCRs to test the leu2::bem2 construct plus 2 PCRs for yll3a positive control. So 12 PCRs per test. 

- [x] 08072020- Plate all biological replicates of ylic135 in -leu2+6xade plates and YPD. 

- [x] 10072020- PCRs with the right primer set at 10:30am 
    - Total : 24 PCRs
    - 12 positive controls for leu2:bem2 locus and BEM2 in WT
        - primer set 41/49 , 42/50 for the mutants and 41/47 and 42/48 for WT
    - 12 negative controls for not having BEM2 in leu2 locus and not having leu2 marker in BEM2 locus in WT. 
        - primer set 41/47 and 42/48 for the mutants and 41/49 and 42/50 for the WT , yll3a genomic DNA.
- [x] Gel 110V 25 mins 

## Results

![](../images/10072020-leu-bem2-locus-check-right-primers.png)

- Finally got some bands due to the use of the right primers!!
- It seems the right strains are the slowest ones , colony 13 and 16. All of the rest , it seems they also have BEM2 there (weird..) and the leu2 marker in the right position. 
- It seems colony 8, 12 and 7 are diploids (?)

## Conclusion

- colony 13 and 16 seems to be the right one that has leu2::bem2 and no BEM2 present. 
- They are also the slowest one from the Biotek measurement of population growth rates. 

## Next Steps

- Transform them with the plasmid pBK549 to do SATAY on them, hopefully also send the data as Enzo for sequencing.
