# Title : 07082019-Crossing of yEK7a with ylic133_1 :heart:

# Date
07082019-09082019

# Objective

In order to do SATAY on the specific genotypes, I have to get a diploid heterozygous on bem1::KanMx , bem3::NAT, nrp1::Hygro , bem2::leu2, and homozygous on ade2- and ura3-

# Method
- 07082019- Growth in a YPD plate [yEK7a](../../2019-07-04_Strain_tableSATAY.md) and  [ylic133_1](../../2019-07-04_Strain_tableSATAY.md) separately.
- 08082019-Mix equal small amounts (1/5 of a typical sized colony is sufficient) of each strain together on an area of fresh YPD agar. Take care to ensure mixing is thorough, to enhance the frequency of mating. Patch the two parent strains separately on a different area of the plate.

- In this case **it is not possible to use  auxotrophic selection to obtain the diploid**  because ylic133_1 doesnt have  aminoacid production neither  antibiotic resistance .
- [x] After 5–8 h mating check under the microscope for the formation of shmoos (elongated, pear-shaped cells), mating figures (dumb-bell figures) and zygotes (3-pointed dumb-bells formed by mating of an a and an α cell followed by emergence of a bud as the diploid cell begins to proliferate).
-  Zygotes typically develop by 8–10 h after mixing. Spread the mating mixture along one side of a YPD agar plate, identify zygotes by their characteristic 3-point dumb-bell morphology and micromanipulate them to a clear area of the plate.
- [x] After germination, verify that they are diploid by absence of expression of a mating type  and/or ability to sporulate .
- 09082019- I selected 4 patches and grow them in liquid YPD media from 9:30am until they are dense (should be around 4 hours)
- Then I will do the sporulation protocol from 14:00 until 21:00 and put it in KAc over the weekend, to have a quick check if they form spores.
   > - [x] Take a bit from each culture an streak onto a new YPD plate to conserve the strains in case it did work.
