# Title : 24092019- SATAY Sanity check of ylic133 pink biological replicates

# Date
24092019-

# Objective
To ensure that the constructed strain is able to pass the Satay sanity check , and then I can continue with the further steps, like mating with yEK7a.

# Method
- 24092019 @16:30 Plating in YPD plates all glycerol stocks of the different biologcal replicates.

  - @13:50 Inoculation of one single colonie from ylic133_4 plate, and a bit more than a colony of ylic133_4 as well , Byk832 and one single white colony from ylci133_1 in YPD+6xADE (that was the amount Enzo used for the last succesful pBK549 transformation=0.055g of ADE in 500 ml of media) [<font color='CornflowerBlue'> Look here into the pBK549 transformation on 05082019](../2019-08/2019-08-05_Exp-Byk832-transformation-with-pBK549.md). <font color='black'> This is to decrease the changes of supressors that supress the pink phenotype. This inoculation is to transform them with pBK549 plasmid.
  - Use Byk832 as a positive control for the transformation. Inoculate it at the same time as the pink ylic133 clones and one yellow to reconfirm that this clone can not be used for SATAY.

  - See the following picture from [<font color='CornflowerBlue'> this page](https://www.phys.ksu.edu/gene/GENEFAQ.html) <font color='black'> to confirm that the yellow phenotype I see in some of the ylic133 clones is because mutations in some other ade genes in the adenine biosynthesis pathway.

- 26092019 - restreaking of different colonies from clone 5 of ylic133, to hopefully clean up the glycerol stock.
