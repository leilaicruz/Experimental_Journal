# Objective
To learn about the whole technique and detect the main issues and bottlenecks when used it for the target strain.

# Method

1. Streak the chosen Byk832 transformed cells that display full growth in -URA and medium growth in -ade, in -ura.
2. **Pre-culture step**

    - Scrape cells from SD-URA, inoculate **20-30mL** SD-URA 0.2% glucose +2% Raffinose at OD600=0.16-0.24 (OD=0.06 works as well)
    - Incubate at 30C, 140-160 rpm, to OD=4-6 (around 20h)
    - It is recommended to start with 3-4 precultures and later chose which to reseed in SD-ADE 2% Glucose.

    | Strain  | Preculture  |   |   |
    |---|---|---|---|
    |   | OD start  |  OD stop |  Time  |
    | Byk832T_1  |   |   |   |
    | Byk832T_2  |   |   |   |
    | Byk832T_3  |   |   |   |

3. **Induction**

    - Inoculate **200ml SD-URA 2% Galactose at OD600=0.2** from the saturated preculture.
    - Incubate at 30C , 140 to 160 rpm for **50-52 hours**
    - To evaluate the background:

        - Spread 200ul of this inoculum on SD-ADE

    
4. **Reseed**
