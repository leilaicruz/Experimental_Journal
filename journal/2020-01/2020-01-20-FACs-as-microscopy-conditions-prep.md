# Title: FACs experiment with the same conditions as the microscopy done to quantify the cell sizes for the pAl1-Cdc42-sfGFP strains.

## Date
20012020-

## Objective
To be able to compare the results of the FACs with the microscopy conditions.
And also to see if we get a difference in expression when increasing the incubation temperature to 36C.

## Method
- In order to have the same conditions as the microscopy done in December 2018 , where we quantify the cell sizes after 24 hours of incubation in X% galactose (after a washing step from a firsto overnight incubation in 2% galactose), the media has to have 4x the normal amount of aminoacids. This maybe has an impact on the regulation of the promoter.
- The new plate design for this is shown in @fig:plate-design

- The strain ywkd024 will be measured to still compared with previous measurements done by Marit, in 2017.
