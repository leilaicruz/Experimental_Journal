# Title: 27082019-Sporulation protocol of 8 re-streakings from ylic133_5+yEk7a :pensive:

## Date
27082019-06092019

## Objective
To test the ability of mating using liquid drops of ylic133_5 and yEK7a


## Method
- Sporulation protocol
  - Incubation in YP+KAc @ 9:30am
  - Incubation in MiliQ+KAc @ 17:45, total of 8 tubes.
- Selection Protocol 02092019
  - 10x and 100x dilution of spores of the 8 tubes in YPD+G418+Hygro+NAT
  - 100x dilution in YPD as positive control
- I want to select for those haploids that grow in G418+Hygro+NAT and they are ade2 defficient. (pink colonies in YPD+G418+Hygro+NAT )

## Results
- The efficiency of sporulation was very low, less than 20% of the cells did sporulate, from the 10X microscope inspection.
- Still with this low number, I decided to proceed with th selection protocol.
- The selection protocol did not work, I did not found any colony growing even in the YPD plates after 4 days of incubation.
## Conclusion

- It seems I kill all cells during the selection protocol, because most of them were haploids and with the zymolyase treatment I kill them.
- There is a problem , still unsolved with the mating process between those strains.

## Next steps

- Repeat it using 2 more positive controls : yEK7a+yll3a (alpha type), and ylic133 + ylic128 (mating type a)
