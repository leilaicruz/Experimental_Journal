# Title: Checking bem2 deletion on the transformed strain ylic133_5

## Date

30042020- 

## Method

1. Colony PCR with specific primers from inside the leu2 marker and the bem2 gene. [Check the documentation for the transformation](../2020-02/2020-02-23-ylic133-5-transformations.md)

    - This is now possible because I have sequenced the transformed strains that grew in -leu2 , and I have the right sequence to design the correct primers. Previously we couldn do it because the leu2 marker was taken from a plasmid but the marker was not completely annotated where it starts and ends.

### Procedure

- 30042020 - Streak out the glycerol stocks of all the colonies from ylic135 (colony 7,8,12,13 and 16) on CSM-leu2 plate and also ylic133 (WT ade2-) in YPD for further colony picking for the colony PCR.
