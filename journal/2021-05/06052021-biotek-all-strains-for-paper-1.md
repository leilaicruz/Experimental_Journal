# Title: Biotek - 1st experiment for paper all strains

## Date

06052021-10052021

## Objective

- To check that the sfGFP do not influence the phenotype of the population growth of the pGal strains 

## Method

- Population growth rate in the Biotek
- Layout:Two plates

- Incubation at 11:15
- Initial amount from thawed glycerol stock:

    - 5ul for ywkd073I and ywkd073II (from previous miserable growth)
    - 1ul for the rest 

- Measuring 08052021
  - 200x dilution for all strains 

## Results

### After incubation

### After measuring

- Observations
  - ywkd073 (dbem1dbem3) during the measuring part grows extremely miserable
    - perhaps next time do not dilute 200x but 100x
  - all gal strains shows the expected behaviour at 0% gal. (with the exception of ywkd071II and ywkd073II in plate 2)
  - ylic139 (dbem1 pgal) shows growth already in 0.01% gal in both plates while ywkd069a (dbem1 pgal-sfGFP) in 0.05% gal. 

## Conclusion

- Data analysis:
