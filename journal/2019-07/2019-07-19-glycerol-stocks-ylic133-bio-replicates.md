# Date
Friday, 19072019

# Objective

To have ylic133 stored for future use.

# Method

I stored clones 1, 2 and 3 which are :
- **NOT PINK** , so would be worth it to sequence them in the future, maybe they have a mutation that prevent them for being pink.
- They are the faster growers compared with clones 4 and 5, which **I did not take for glycerol stocks.**

I will also store clones 6,7 and 9:
