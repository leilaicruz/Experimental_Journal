# Title: Transformation/checking on ylic136 and ylic138 with bem1::KANMX 

## Date

11082021-

## Objective

- To get the strain $\Delta$nrp1 $\Delta$bem1 and $\Delta$nrp1 $\Delta$bem3 $\Delta$bem1 for SATAY

## Method

### Materials

- Purified PCR product containing bem1::KanMX with homology arms. 
  - PCR product from yll117 and olic54/55 
  - PCR purified product : 233ng/ul 
  - Volume: 29uL 
  - Total: 6.7ug 

![Correct band](../Images/11082021_PCR_succesful_for_dbem1_cassette.png)

- Selection plates 
  - Fresh plates of YPD+6xADE+HYGRO+G418 and +/- NAT 

### Transformation 

- Yeast transformation protocol 
- 11082021, at 17:00 : Incubation of ylic136 and ylic138 in fresh liquid YPD+6xade + corresponding antibiotics. 
- Transformation on 13082021 :
  - OD 10x dilution: 
    - ylic136: 0.9 > OD ~10 
    - ylic138: 0.9 > OD ~10 

  - at 10:00 - I diluted the cultures 10X to reach an OD ~ 1 and start transformation once it reaches OD ~2 . 
  - After dilution the cultures had OD ~ 0.1 for a 10x diluted OD measurement culture, so the real OD ~1. 
  - Measure at 13:00 again  
    - OD: ylic136: 1.5, ylic138: 1.7
  - use 14.5 ul PCR product for ylic136 which is 3.4 ug of DNA and around 10ul for ylic138 which is 2.3ug . 
  - recovery step : 1 hour in YPD+6xADE
  - Plating 100ul of non diluted in selection plates, and 100u lof 100X diluted in selection plates, as well as the undiluted negative control. 



## Results

### Transformation plates 

- The negative control for the case of ylic138 is full of colonies which could imply:
  - I made a mistake and I plated a positive control  as a negative control . 
    - Resolve with colony PCR
    
- For the case of ylic136 the negative control is blank as expected. And there are many colonies for the positive control.
