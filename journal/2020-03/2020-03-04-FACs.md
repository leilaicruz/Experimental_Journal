# Title : 20200305-FACs experiment with strains ywkd065, ywkd024, ywkd038 and ywkd001


## Date

02032020-05032020

## Objective

- To measure using the **height** channel the fluorescence intensities (to understand why the heights and not the area,  look [here](2020-02-21-hands-on-data-from-facs.md)) in different galactose concentrations of the strains:
  - ywkd024, ywkd038,ywkd001,ywkd065
  - ywkd024 : RWS119	Wedlich-Söldner Lab collection	a	W303 *can 1 1-100		his3 11,15	Galpr-myc-**GFP**-CDC42	YipLac204-MET-CLN2	cln1$\Delta$::HisG, cln2$\Delta$, cln3$\Delta$::HisG*	(**strain to compare with ywkd065(sfGFP)**)
  - ywkd038: RWS1421	Wedlich-Söldner Lab collection	a	W303	*can1 1-100		his3 11,15	CDC42pr-myc-**GFP**-CDC42		YipLac204-MET-CLN2	cln1$\Delta$::HisG, cln2$\Delta$, cln3$\Delta$::HisG*	 (**Reference for the native CDC42 expression**)
  - ywkd001: 	$\alpha$	W303 *can 1 1-100		his3 11,15	leu2 3,112*		S288C ,yLL3a -Laan Lab collection (**Reference for the background fluorescence**)
  - ywkd065a	New	YWKD055c		W303		*URA-Gal1pr-**sfGFP**-Cdc42 sandwich (pWKD011 integrated)	leu2 3,112	his 3 11,15*

## Method
  - Plate design :

    ![](../images/96-well-plate-design_design-27022020.png){width=50%}

- 1st incubation in 30C in 02032020
  - The cells for ywkd024 and ywkd038 were single colonies from the plates of 30C in raffinose.

    ![Phenotype comparison of ywkd24 and ywkd038 varying temperature and sugar source. 108 hours after plating](../images/plating-pictures_108-h-plating.png){#fig:phenotype-checking-108 width=50%}
- 2nd incubation in 30C in 04032020 at 10:30
  - all the strains had a good pellet to distribute.
  - I washed two times in CSM, CSM-met accordingly + 2% Raff, then resuspended the cells in 2.5ml of these media, and distribute 2ul in each tube containing 5ml media + x% gal.

- at 13:30 the FACs started.
  - observations: The ywkd024 and ywkd038 strains were still transparent , so maybe still in lagphase. For next time I should put more cells to inoculate to increase the chances of getting out the lagphase. So I think around 100ul of pellet.

## Results:

## Conclusion

- One take home message  is to grow more amount of cells for ywkd024 and ywkd038 because they have very large lag phase, and it seems by taking very small amount as I did in this experiment I increase the chances of taking slow growers (?)
- However they grew much better than in the previous experiment. Yet they were not expressing much CDC42 (ywkd24)
- In 0% gal , the fluorescence the wild type show is the left over after 24 hours in this concentration. Which can be used to estimate the amount of cdc42 we see in the microscopy experiments. So in this case will be that in 0% gal, the wt has around 0.38x the native amount and dbem1 was almost dead and also dbem1dbem3.

| Gal concentration | [cdc42-gal]/mean-ref |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| 0% Gal            | 0.380224             |
| 0.01% Gal         | 0.679128             |
| 0.02% Gal         | 0.729760             |
| 0.06% Gal         | 0.741663             |
| 0.08% Gal         | 1.081503             |
| 0.1% Gal          | 0.917127             |
| 0.2% Gal          | 1.909962             |
| 2% Gal            | 2.913480             |


## Next steps

- [ ] Do microscopy on the cells before doing FACs to check the state/ proportion of aggregates from sfGFP during the measurements.
