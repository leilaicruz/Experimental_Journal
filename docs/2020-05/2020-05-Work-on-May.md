# Title : Work on May 2020

## Date 

04062020

## Results

- Replication of code of the paper: "Predicting yeast synthetic lethal genetic interactions using protein domains" See code here in the repo [HERE](https://github.com/leilaicruz/machine-learning-for-yeast/blob/dev_Leila/functions-python/prot_domains2lethality_replication-from-paper.ipynb) , and also in a Jupyter Book [HERE](https://leilaicruz.github.io/jupyter-book/machine-learning-replication-protein-domains.html) :) Inside the Jupyter Book there is the possibility of open the code as a notebook via Binder that give the chance to run the code because it will create a server and install of the necessary packages, provided in the environment.yml file. 

- Study on how common Go terms and common genetic interactors is correlated with the type of interaction. The code is in Github , [HERE](https://github.com/leilaicruz/machine-learning-for-yeast/blob/leila_common2type/interactions-from-commons-measures.ipynb)
