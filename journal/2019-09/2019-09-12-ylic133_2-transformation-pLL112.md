# Title : 12092019-Transformation of yli133 with the pLL112 plasmid

# Date
12092019-
# Objective
To mark temporarily ylic133 in order to be able to select for diploids after the mating with yEK7a.

# Method
- Plasmid transformation using pLL112: pRS416 (URA3 CEN6_ARSH4)
- 12092019: Incubation of ylic133_2 in 10mL YP+2% Dextrose
- 13092019: OD measurements @9:30am

  |   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Dilution factor to OD=0.5   |Time|
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | ylic133_2  |0.259   | 2.6  | 5.2  | @9:30 |
- 2h after the 5x dilution of the dense culture in 10mL YPD
  |   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Time|
  |---|---|---|---|
  | ylic133_2  |0.126   | 1.3  | @11:30|


  |   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Time|
  |---|---|---|---|
  | ylic133_2  |0.239   | 2.4  | @13:30|
- 5ul of pLL112 plasmid , which has 2290ng/mL
# Results
![](../images/17092019-ylic133_2+pLL112-results-contamination.png)
- 17092019- I found bacterial contamination on the plates :(
- 17092019- The transformants on the -ura plate are extremely tiny colonies
- 17092019 - Incubate ylic133-3 to redo transformation
- 18092019 - The  liquid culture was not dense enough to do the experiment.
- 19092019 - I diluted the culture 1000x to do transformation next day.
- 20092019 - Transformation with pLL112 (from a miniprep Ramon did the day before)
  - pLL112-148ng/ul , I used 10ul for transformation , hence I used 1.5 ug of plasmid
  - I plated two positive controsl in -ura and all the negative control in -ura.
