# Title : How different are the number of interactors of essential genes compared with non essential genes. 

## Date
22062020

## Objective

To see if the number of interactors of essential genes , registered from the database of the Boone Lab , are indeed higher than non essential genes. 
 This is to evaluate the hypothesis that essential genes are prone to be higher connected than non essential genes. 

## Method
- Taking the data from thecellmap.org from Boone Lab and the list of essential genes in budding yeast, and plotting a histogram of the number of interactors per condition.

## Results

## Conclusion

- It seems that for essential genes the probability that those genes are more connected than non essentials is a bit higher. 
- There are few genes largely connected that could be essential and non essential (see the tail of the box plot)
