# Objective
To assess what is the best strategy to go further in terms , of realiability and background compatibility.

# Method

|   | Strategy  | Pros  | Cons  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategy 1  | - Cross dbem1dbem3dnrp1dbem2 ura3 <br> (from Enzo) with ylic133 <br> - Sporulate the diploid and select <br> for all deletions  without ura3 and ade2. <br> - Cross again with ylic133 and have <br> homozygous ura3 and ade2 auxotrophies.  | I keep the same background as ylic133 <br> After having the homozygous diploid <br> I just select for the different <br> target genes.   |  Could be work demanding |
| Strategy 2   | - Cross ylic128(dbem1dbem3dnrp1) with ylic133 <br> to form a diploid, homozygous in ura3- <br> - Sporulate and select for <br> dbem1dbem3dnrp1 ura3- ade2- <br> Cross againg with ylic133 to have <br>| Same as Strategy 1, just I wont have <br> bem2 in the study | - Work demanding, <br> because I have to select <br> for many markers
