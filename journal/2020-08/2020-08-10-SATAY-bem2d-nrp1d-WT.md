# Title : 20200810-SATAY for $\Delta$bem2, $\Delta$nrp1 and WT

## Date
10082020 - 18082020

## Objective

- To test the technique on the mutants and also to have data for the data analysis pipeline from Greg.

## Method

- 10082020-Preculture in SD-URA+0.2%glucose +2% raffinose at 14:20 
    - Scrape from the colonies from each background that passed the test (2 per each background)
    - Inoculate to a final volume of 20mL and to a final OD of 0.2
- **11082020**
    - OD measurement
      - OD really low around 0.3 for all strains which could be due to the fact that the media did not contain extra adenine. 
      - Add 6x ADE to the media which means: 44mg in 400mL . 

      - ```SO I RESTARTED THE PRECULTURE ON 11082020```
    
- **12082020** - Induction in SD-URA+2% gal (I also added 6XAde to this media) to a final OD of 0.2 - 50 hours (2 days)
  - OD measurement:

| Strain  |  OD 10x dilution  | ReaL OD | Dilution Factor to OD=0.2  | Time of preculture|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ylic133_1  | 0.659 |  6.6 | ~30  |20h  |
| ylic133_2  | 0.577 | 5.7  |  ~30 |20h  |
| ylic135_1 | 0.073 | 0.7  | ~3  |20h  |
| ylic135_2  | 0.126  | 1.26  | ~6  |20h  |
| ylic136_1  | 0.678  | 6.7  | ~30  |20h  |
| ylic136_2 | 0.626 | 6.3 |  ~30 |20h  |

- Issues :
  - The ylic135 strains grows a bit more slower than the rest which is expected due to the phenotype of not having bem2. But the  amount of culture I need to add in order to have a final OD of 0.2 in 150mL is 50 mL and I only had 20mL. Therefore the initial OD of the induction will be around 0.1 for this strain. 


- Measure the background (T=0 of induction)

    - [x] Plate 200ul of the inoculum in SD-ADE+ 2% dextrose (expect 40-80 colonies per 200uL)

    - [x] Dilute 1000x and spread 200ul in SD-URA
- [x] Prepare 3 flasks of 3L of SD-ADE media for the reseed of three strains
   - Per flask of 3L , add: 2,4L MiliQ to autoclave, dissolve 2.34g of -ade drop out + 20.7g of YNB (005) and filter sterilize it and add it after autoclaving the MiliQ.  Add 300mL of 20% dextrose after autoclaving. 


- **13082020** 
- [x] Plating in SD-ADE to check induction after T=22h and SD-URA 1000x dilution.
- [x] Check OD (should be around 4-5) at 10:45am

| Strain  |  OD 10x dilution  | ReaL OD | Time | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ylic133_1  | 0.472 |  4.7 | 24h  |
| ylic133_2  | 1.17 | **11.7**  |  24h |
| ylic135_1 | 0.223 | 2.23  | 24h  |
| ylic135_2  | 0.217  | 2.17  | 24h  |
| ylic136_1  | 1.17  | **11.7**  | 24h  |
| ylic136_2 | 1.13 | **11.3** |  24h |

  - Strains ylic133_2 and ylic136 have a very high OD
  - The cell culture of ylic133_1 have turned pink...
  - Still the background at T=0 can not be clearly determined. 

- **14082020** - End of induction/Reseed at 14:00 
  - Choose the 3 strains to continue for the reseed that has the least number of ADE+ cells at T=0 and the highest number of ADE+ after induction. 
      - It seems that ylic133_2, ylic136_1 and ylic136_2 are the ones that have the least background at T=0 before induction. 

- Background check at 9:30am


| Strain  |  ade+ clones/mL | ura+ clones/mL | Time | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ylic133_1  | < 5 |  ~100* 5* E3 = 5*E5 | 0h Induction  |
| **ylic133_2**  | ~30*5 = 150 | 5 *E5  |  0h Induction |
| ylic135_1 | - | -  | 0h Induction  |
| ylic135_2  |- | -  | 0h Induction  |
| **ylic136_1**  | ~ 80*5=400  | 5 *E5  | 0h Induction  |
| **ylic136_2** | ~ 80*5=400 | 5 *E5 |  0h Induction |

- [x] Reseed at 13:30 

- **17082020**

- [x] Check ADE+ cells during induction. Counting colonies from each plate. 
  - Image J protocol: 
    1. select image of interest: circle tool and edit-> clear outside
    2. Image ->  Type -> 16bits
    3. Make sure to capture the maximum number of right colonies: Image -> Adjust -> Threshold . Make sure the colonies are all red.
    4. Process -> Make binary-> Watershed
    5. Analyse ->  Analyse Particles 



- **18082020** 
- [x] OD measurement for T=92h after reseeding at 12:00
- [x] Plate 200ul with 1000X dilution in SD-Ade , and 200ul with 40000X dilution in SD-ura to estimate the growth of ade+cells compared with the T=0 of reseeding. Expect  that the ade+ cells have grown by a factor of ~1000x.

#### Defining the complexity of the library

- The number of ADE+ cells reseeded minus the number of background ADE+ cells is the complexity of the library.

- To determine the complexity of the library, you should know: 
  - #ADE+ per ml at the start of the reseed, 
  - Volume of reseed.  
  - If you harvest all the culture: 

For strain 1:

OD8 ~8E+7 cells/ml -> 7.47E+11/ 8E+7~10L

- The  number of URA+ cells per ml at the end of the regrowth is 19200000 -> 7.47E+11/ 19.2E+5 ~ 38L

- I reseed in a volume of 3L :

  If so, the complexity of the library is 5E+3 * 3*10E+3= 1.5E+7
- Complexity = $ADE+|_{T=0(reseed)}$ * Volume of reseed

#### Number of cycles during the reseed

- The number of cycles that each ADE+ cells has done during the regrowth of the libraries as follow:

  - N=ln(#ADE+ per ml STOP reseed/#ADE+ per ml START reseed)/ln(2)

  - N_ WT=9.34
  - N_dnrp1_1=9.06
  - N_dnrp1_2=8.67


## Results

- For the strain ylic135 it did not work, because it is very miserable to culture with others. It grows much more slower , so maybe growing it more and with less volume , for next time. Also ylic135 gives a relatively high background compared with the growth in -URA. 

- The way of computing the number of colonies in highly dense plates is pretty inaccurate with the best tool to do it which is ImageJ. So I think that is why I get like an order of magnitude lower than the number of colonies expected by Benoit. 

-  The pellet from the reseed culture was pink , which could mean that there were many cells ade- that did not have any transposon event. Hence I suspect the sequencing/transposon coverage will be not optimal. 

- The number of ADE+ cells after reseeding is around 1000X times higher than at then of the induction which is what was expected :) 

## Next steps

- DNA sequencing protocol 
- Repeat the SATAY for ylic135 from the beginning 


## Conclusion

- First round of SATAY :) with WT and dnrp1 strains. 
- Next time I will:
  - Also plate the cells in CSM in order to capture the whole population.
  - Also plate the cells during the induction in -URA mainly to know the number of cells before the reseeding and to quantify better the ADe+/ADE- ratio across induction.
