## Context

They have already sequenced for my project the: 

- WT
- dnrp1


## Research question 

- How are the genes required for growth changing through genetic backgrounds? A study on a reproducible evolutionary trajectory recovering polarity establishment in budding yeast. 
- How can we explain the cell polarity recovery based on the genes that are required for growth in every step of the trajectory? 
- Using this approach , can we generalize this trajectory to other essential functions in the cell? 

## Material and Methods 

- Sequencing of DNA from 
    - dbem3 (made)
    - dbem3dbem1 (in progress)
    - dbem3dnrp1 (made)
    - dbem3dnrp1dbem1 (to be made)
    - dnrp1dbem1 (to be made)
