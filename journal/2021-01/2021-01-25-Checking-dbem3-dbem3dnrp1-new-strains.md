# Title : PCR and sequencing checks for the new strains dbem3 and dbem3dnrp1 

## Date

25012021

## Objective

To check that the transformation were inserted in the right locations

## Method

1.  Replate the strains in YPD plate (they were more than one month in the fridge)

2. Inoculation in 5mL YPD+6xade with NAT for dbem3 cells (colonies 10,11,12,13,14)and NAT+ HYGRO for 5 colonies from  dbem3dnrp1 cells . (26012021)
   1. Three tubes out of 5 from dbem3dnrp1 cells were dense the rest not, after 24h of incubation. They were not contaminated when looking through the microscope I only saw yeast cells. 
   2. Only one tube was dense for dbem3 cells ,and that was contaminated with bacteria. I looked the suspicious tube through the microscope. 


3. Store in glycerol stocks from liquid culture
   1. I stored the three dense tubes from dbem3dnrp1 cells (colony 2,10,11)
   2. I did not store anything from dbem3 cells. 

#### Colony PCR 

  - Use the colonies from the replate used to inoculated in liquid culture. 
  - Design sequencing primers 
    - spy6/7 from Els(bem3)(oLL401/402)
    - spy1/2 from Els(nrp1)
   - 1uL template (one colony in 50mL)
   - **I wrongly used 1uM from oLL401/402 instead of 10uM** because I diluted 10x from a 10uM stock .... 
   - I used both set of primers in all the templates. 
 - 27012021: repeat the PCR with the right primers concentration and the same colonies I have kept in MiliQ in eppis. 
   - use 5ul of template
 - [x] Restreak more colonies from the original selection plate from the transformation for dbem3 on YPD+NAT plate. 
   - I restreak like 16 colonies more and surprisingly they showed very miserably growth after a weekend growth period. 
   - PCR on the three more grown colonies with SPY1/2 and oLL401/402 primer sets, and the same protocol as before. I used 5ul template.
     
   -  [x] Try again same PCR with 1ul template
  
  - Incubate in liquid media YPD+6x+NAT single colonies from the streak 1, 2 and 3 from dbem3 colonies. Also incubated the colony 1 mixed in MiliQ used for colony PCR in YPD+6x+NAT media to compare the consistency from the colony taken from the streak 1. 
    - The only grown culture was from colony 1 from the plate. The one from the eppi did not grow (?)
    - [ ] Colony PCR with the culture with colony 1. 
      -  550ul  of 2x washed liquid culture in MiliQ and resuspended in 50uL MiliQ. I took 1uL template for PCR. 
      -  PCR protocol: annealing temperature gradient to find the optimal conditions for this PCR. (56C,58C,60C,65C) and also increasing to 3mins the step with 98C which is the one who breaks the cell wall . In the previous experiments was set to 30secs, so maybe it is not sufficient to get enough template.
      -  I also used 1uL gDNA from ywt04 as a positive control with oLL401/402 primers.  
  

## Results

- No product from PCR
- 
![](../images/27012021-PCR-test-nrp1-bem3-MISTAKE-WITH-BEM3-PRIMERS-CONCENTRATION.png)

- Confirming three clones from dbem3dnrp1 strains (colonies 2,10 and 11). **The same clones that grew on liquid media YPD+NAT+HYGRO :)**
- Glycerol stock storage: ylic138 a,b,c (3 biological replicates)

  - All checked bem3d colonies are not correct because the band shown for the oLL401/042 primers indicates that BEM3 is present in them.
  - **NO PCR PRODUCT for dbem3 taken colonies** , 5ul template. 
  
    ![No PCR product](../images/02022021-FAILURE-check-for-dbem3-colonies.png)
    
  - **NO PCR PRODUCT for dbem3 taken colonies** , 1ul template. 
  
    ![Not conclusive PCR product](../images/02022021-FAILURE-check-for-dbem3-colonies-1ul-template.png)
  
- **NO PCR PRODUCT for dbem3 colonies. Correct positive control**

## Next Steps

1. - [ ] Sequencing of correct mutants on bem3::NAT transformation.
