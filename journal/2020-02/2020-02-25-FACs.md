# Title : FACs experiment with strains ywkd065, ywkd024, ywkd038 and ywkd001


## Date

27022020

## Objective

- To measure using the **height** channel the fluorescence intensities (to understand why the heights and not the area,  look [here](2020-02-21-hands-on-data-from-facs.md)) in different galactose concentrations of the strains:
  - ywkd024, ywkd038,ywkd001,ywkd065
  - ywkd024 : RWS119	Wedlich-Söldner Lab collection	a	W303 *can 1 1-100		his3 11,15	Galpr-myc-**GFP**-CDC42	YipLac204-MET-CLN2	cln1$\Delta$::HisG, cln2$\Delta$, cln3$\Delta$::HisG*	(**strain to compare with ywkd065(sfGFP)**)
  - ywkd038: RWS1421	Wedlich-Söldner Lab collection	a	W303	*can1 1-100		his3 11,15	CDC42pr-myc-**GFP**-CDC42		YipLac204-MET-CLN2	cln1$\Delta$::HisG, cln2$\Delta$, cln3$\Delta$::HisG*	 (**Reference for the native CDC42 expression**)
  - ywkd001: 	$\alpha$	W303 *can 1 1-100		his3 11,15	leu2 3,112*		S288C ,yLL3a -Laan Lab collection (**Reference for the background fluorescence**)
  - ywkd065a	New	YWKD055c		W303		*URA-Gal1pr-**sfGFP**-Cdc42 sandwich (pWKD011 integrated)	leu2 3,112	his 3 11,15*

## Method
- Plate design :

  ![](../images/96-well-plate-design_design-27022020.png){width=50%}

- In this FACS I will use a slightly different method concerning the temperature incubation and the rotation of  the samples. Now we have the following issue:
  - Cells in 36C oven are not rotating , only shaking,  hence they sediment over time. This is not ideal because we dont have a proper mixing of nutrients.
- So , to avoid this, I will incubate them in 30C in the rotating wheel for  all the steps and only the last day , I will put them in 36C , for about 5h with a periodically vortex event, every 30 mins (Liedewij suggestion) . The cells were transferred on 25022020 to 30C about 5 hours later of being incubated in 36C.
- 26022020 : Results of 1st incubation at 9:00am:
  - ywkd065 and ywkd001 had nice density to have a good pellet of cells to distribute over the galactose concentrations.
  - ywkd024 and ywkd038 were all transparent :( Extremely low density of cells. (?)
- 2nd incubation for ywkd065 and ywkd001 at 10:25 am.
  - I inoculated 5ul of a resuspended culture in 2ml in all the tubes with CSM+x%gal+2% Raff.
  - **Important note**:

    > I realised later in the afternoon I did a mistake with the media with x% galactose concentrations. I put 1ml of the 10x concentrated sugar in 4.5ml of the CSM media with 2% raffinose. This means I put the doouble of sugar I usually put , and instead of diluting the 10X concentrated sugar 10 times  I did 5,5 times (5,5ml/1ml). **Hence all my galactose concentrations are going to be multiplied by a factor 0f 1.8 , that is , I will have: 0.018%, 0.036%, 0.108%, 0.144%,0.18%,0.36%,3.6%.**
  - **How did I realised this mistake?** (equally important)
    - I observed that when I was going to the same for the other strains in the afternoon, the 1mL pipette was by default set in 1mL and the last thing I did was the previous step, so if  I did correctly it should have 500ul as default .
    - Then I checked the volume for the tubes , because for the x% gal tubes they should have the same volume  as the 0% gal tube (5ml), but they had larger volume confirming the hypothesis that I inoculated 1ml of the 10x concentrated sugar for a final volume of 5.5ml.
- 2nd incubation for ywkd024 and ywkd038
  - I inoculated 10ul of a resuspended culture in 1ml of ywkd038 (it had a bit more density than ywkd024)
  - I inoculated 100ul of a resuspended culture in 1ml of ywkd024 in all the tubes.
  - I continue with the  same "mistake" of the galactose concentrations to be able to compare later on the results.
- There is one thing very worrysome to me , and it is the fact ywkd024 and ywkd038 grow so slowly with the combination of raffinose and galactose.
  - [X] I will make CSM-met+ agar plates with 2% Raff + 2% Galactose and 2% Glucose + 2% galactose , and do a restreak onto these plate and incubated in 30C and 36 C to see the differences .

- 27022020 : Day of measuring
  - I transfer them to 36C shaker at 9:00am and vortex two times before plating to measure at 12:30.
  - ywkd065 and ywkd001 were dense in almost all galactose concentrations. I diluted the dense ones 20X.
  - ywkd024 and ywkd038 were transparent. In the FACs, indeed I had very low counts mainly for ywkd024.

## Next steps

- Since the counts of strains ywkd038 and ywkd024 were very poor I decided to check if the temperature and/or sugar source have an impact on the phenotype of those strains. See figure below:

![Phenotype comparison of ywkd24 and ywkd038 varying temperature and sugar source. 24 hours after plating](../images/plating-pictures_24-h-plating.png){#fig:phenotype-checking-24 width=50%}

![Phenotype comparison of ywkd24 and ywkd038 varying temperature and sugar source. 108 hours after plating](../images/plating-pictures_108-h-plating.png){#fig:phenotype-checking-108 width=50%}

  - We can observe that indeed incubation in 36C and using Raffinose as sugar source is detrimental for the normal growth of the cells.
  - We can see that the growth in Raffinose at 30C is OK.
  - It seems that for glucose the effect is the opposite. For T=36C the growth seems better than for 30C.

## Conclusion
