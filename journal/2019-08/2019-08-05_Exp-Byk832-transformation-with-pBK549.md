# Title: 05082019-Byk832 transformation with pBk549

# Date
05082019

# Objective

To succesfully transform Byk832 :pray: with the pBK549 plasmid, because so far we have got very low yield in the transformation and it seems that also the transformants are not the right cells for SATAY (look at the unpassed required test,:point_right: [:(->Check](../2019-07/2019-07-31-Extra-checking-steps-SATAY-Byk832T.md))

# Method

- This time we (me and Enzo) will also transform yLL3a, ylic33_1, besides Byk832, to have another strain to see if we get the same efficiency as before and for the case of ylic133_1, to also test the background one the check of hardly growth in -ade and fully growth  is succesfully passed.

- 10ml YPD incubation 14:30 (05082019)
- Dilution 2000X of yll3a and ylic133_1 in a final volume of 20mL, and 2X dilution of Byk832 in a final volume of 20mL. (06082019 13:30)
- OD measurements of the overnight culture:

| Strain  | OD (100x diluted) | Titer| Dilution factor to OD=0.5 in 25mL|
|---|---|---|---|
|yLL3a   | 0.14 | 14| 28x -> 892uL cells|
|ylic133_1  | 0.095 |9.5| 19x -> 1,316mL cells|
|Byk832  | 0.142 |14| 28x -> 892uL cells|
