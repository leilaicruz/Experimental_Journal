# Title : 01102019- II pBK549 transformation on ylic133 for further sanity check in SATAY.

# Date
01102019-

# Objective
To ensure that the constructed strain is able to pass the Satay sanity check, and then I can continue with the further steps, like mating with yEK7a.

# Method
- 30092019 -Incubation of single colonies from the plates from 24092019 and Byk832 as positive control from glycerol stock @10:30.
- 01102019 - OD measurements @9:35

|   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Dilution factor to OD=0.5   |Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ylic133_1  |1.214  | 12.14  | 24  | @9:35 |
| ylic133_4   |1.216   |12.16  | 24  | @9:35 |
| ylic133_5 |0.316   | 3.16  | 6 | @9:35 |
| Byk832  |0.308 | 3.08  | 6  | @9:35 |

  - @9:55 Incubation at OD~= 0.5 to OD~=2 in YP+6x ADE


  |   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Ready to transform |Time|
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | ylic133_1  |0.121  | 1.21  | close to OD=2  | @13:15 |
  | ylic133_4   |0.118   |1.18  | close to OD=2   | @13:15 |
  | ylic133_5 |0.233   | 2.33  | yes | @13:15 |
  | Byk832  |0.290 | 2.9  | yes  | @13:15 |
  - @14:30 30C incubation
  - 100ng of pBk549
  - **Notes on the procedure** :
    - I did not vortex the cells with the transformation mix, instead I pippeted in and out after each ingredients, by this way I avoided clumps formation that hinder transformation efficiency.
    - I did not use the maximum speed (13300) of the centrifuge to get rid of the LiAc, instead I used 8000rpm.
    - I heated the ssDNA to 95C and then transfered to ice before  I added the 0.1M LiAc , so I could do all steps of LiAc washing and samples separation consecutively.
  - I plated all (200ul) in the selection plates (-URA+6x ADE), both, negative control and transformed cells.
