# Date
12082019

# Objective
To check the clones ability to fully grow in -URA and have few growth in -ade, and select them for glycerol stocks and further SATAY experiment.

# Method
 - We are going to use spot plating , in -ura and -ade to evaluate better the differences in growth. See here the method :point_down:

- Specifically we selected 12 colonies of ylic33_1+pBK549 and Byk832+pBK549
- 3 serial dilutions of each colony, e.g. 10, 100x, 1000x in MiliQ
- I spotted 5ul per dilution on the plate.
