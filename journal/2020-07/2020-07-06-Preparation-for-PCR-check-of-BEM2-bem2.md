## Date
07062020-

## Objective

- [ ] Repeat the test done on [beginning of May](../2020-04/2020-04-30-Checking-bem2-deletion-on-ylic133_5.md) to see if I get something usable...
- [ ] Check the presence of the leu2 marker in the position of bem2 gene , and checking the bem2 absence in the mutants strains. 

## Method

- Colony PCR with freshly grown cells from glycerol stocks.
