# Title: More DNA extraction of dnrp1 and WT strains

## Date

15102020

## Objective

To have more SATAY DNA from WT and dnrp1 strains  to further sequence . 

## Method

- Genomic extraction according Benoit protocol. See [HERE](../2020-08/2020-08-18-DNA-Prep-SATAY.md)
- Use 2x more pellet , and upscaled the whole protocol to have more DNA to play with. 
- Pellet weights:
   - WT: 
   - dnrp1_1:
   - dnrp1_2: 

- The final volume of DNA was :
  - WT: ~ 550uL
  - dnrp1: ~750uL
  - dnrp1 : ~750ul

## Results


![A bit of smear due to shear in the DNA](../Images/15102020-new-dna-extraction.png){width=50%}

- Using Biorad Image Lab software to quantify the bands from gel, taking the 600bp band as a reference.
- The 600bp band has 60ng of DNA in the 1kB GeneRuler ladder.

- The concentrations achieved with this method were:

| Strain 	| Mean (ng/uL) 	| std 	| Significance of the std 	| Final Volume 	| Total DNA 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
| WT 	| 27.911019 	| 1.084485 	| 0.038855084 	| 550 	| 15ug 	|
| dnrp1_1 	| 40.583937 	| 1.576893 	| 0.038855102 	| 750 	| 30ug 	|
| dnrp1_2 	| 34.738095 	| 1.349751 	| 0.038855067 	| 750 	| 26ug 	|

## Conclusion

- I have enough DNA to continue for the digestion and ligation in order to send those samples for sequencing.
