# Title : PCR and sequencing checks for the new strains dbem3 and dbem3dnrp1 

## Date

25012021

## Objective

To check that the transformation were inserted in the right locations

## Method

1.  Replate the strains in YPD plate (they were more than one month in the fridge)

2. Inoculation in 5mL YPD+6xade with NAT for dbem3 cells (colonies 10,11,12,13,14)and NAT+ HYGRO for 5 colonies from  dbem3dnrp1 cells . (26012021)
   1. Three tubes out of 5 from dbem3dnrp1 cells were dense the rest not, after 24h of incubation. They were not contaminated when looking through the microscope I only saw yeast cells. 
   2. Only one tube was dense for dbem3 cells ,and that was contaminated with bacteria. I looked the suspicious tube through the microscope. 


3. Store in glycerol stocks from liquid culture
   1. I stored the three dense tubes from dbem3dnrp1 cells (colony 2,10,11)
   2. I did not store anything from dbem3 cells. 

#### Colony PCR 

  - Use the colonies from the replate used to inoculated in liquid culture. 
  - Design sequencing primers 
    - spy6/7 from Els(bem3)(oLL401/402)
    - spy1/2 from Els(nrp1)
   - 1uL template (one colony in 50mL)
   - **I wrongly used 1uM from oLL401/402 instead of 10uM** because I diluted 10x from a 10uM stock .... 
   - I used both set of primers in all the templates. 
 - 27012021: repeat the PCR with the right primers concentration and the same colonies I have kept in MiliQ in eppis. 
   - use 5ul of template

## Results

- No product from PCR

- Confirming three clones from dbem3dnrp1 strains (colonies 2,10 and 11). **The same clones that grew on liquid media YPD+NAT+HYGRO :)**
- Glycerol stock storage: ylic138 a,b,c (3 biological replicates)

  - All checked bem3d colonies are not correct because the band shown for the oLL401/042 primers indicates that BEM3 is present in them.
  
## Next Steps
1. Restreak more colonies from the original selection plate from the transformation for dbem3 on YPD+NAT plate. 
   1. From the grown clones then do colony PCR on them and grow them on liquid media. 
2. Sequencing of correct mutants on bem3::NAT transformation. 
3.
