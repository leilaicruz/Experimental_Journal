# Title: 22072019-Sequencing of ylic133 biological replicates :ok: :white_check_mark:

# Date
22072019

# Objective
To finally check that neither the adenine , neither ura is in the genome of these cells

# Method

- 10ul Final sample prepration
- 250ng purified PCR product
- 2,5 ul primer 22
- 2,5 ul primer 23
- Rest with MiliQ
- Send for sequencing the clones 1-3 and 7-9


# Results :)

- The results shows a complete coverage of the DNA without URA and ADE2

- With the DNA with URA , we can see that we dont have any URA contained in any of the ylic133 biological replicates. :)

# Conclusion
Everything did work! So, now I can continue with the crossing of the strains with bem1 deleted, bem1bem3d, bem1bem3dnrp1d, and dbem1dbem3dnrp1dbem2.
