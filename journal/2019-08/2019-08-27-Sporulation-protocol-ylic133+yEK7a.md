# Title: Sporulation protocol of 8 re-streakings from ylic133_5+yEk7a

# Date
27082019-02092019

# Objective
To test the ability of mating using liquid drops of ylic133_5 and yEK7a

# Method
- Sporulation protocol
  - Incubation in YP+KAc @ 9:30am
  - Incubation in MiliQ+KAc @ 17:45, total of 8 tubes.
- Selection Protocol 02092019
  - 10x and 100x dilution of spores of the 8 tubes in YPD+G418+Hygro+NAT
  - 100x dilution in YPD as positive control
- I want to select for those haploids that grow in G418+Hygro+NAT and they are ade2 defficient. (pink colonies in YPD+G418+Hygro+NAT )

# Results
- The efficiency of sporulation was very low, less than 20% of the cells did sporulate, from the 10X microscope inspection.
- Still with this low number, I decided to proceed with th selection protocol.
# Conclusion
