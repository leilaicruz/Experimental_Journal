## Date 
08042020

## Objective
- To summarize the new knowledge/limitations acquired after 7 Facs experiments, performed in the period from January to March 2020. 


## Results

1.  The fold change in Cdc42 expression by the pGal1-CDC42-sfGFP strain (ywkd065) relative to the native mean expression given by a strain with GFP in native CDC42 expression, without a galactose promoter, was consistently less that 3 fold from 0 to 2% Gal concentration. Currently we have four independent experiments. 
To look into the details of all of them , I suggest to look at this [excel document](C:\Users\linigodelacruz\Documents\PhD_2018\Work with Fridtjof paper\Main_paper_experimental_figure\FACS-new-experiment\Leila-FACS\summary-FACs-experiments-table.xlsx)

![Summary of four FACs experiments in terms of the relative CDC42 expression](../images/four-Facs-independent-exps.png){#fig:summary}

2. Not consistency on the emission fluorencence spectrum of sfGFP vs GFP, in order to compare the reference strain (CDC42-GFP) with the target strain (pGal1-CDC42-sfGFP)

3- Not all experiments are shown in @fig:summary because of issues with cell sedimentation due to a proper shaking in the 36C incubator in experiment 4 and experiment 5. For the case ofe experiment 7 , I did a mistake in the galactose concentrations .
