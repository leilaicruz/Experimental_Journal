# Date
22082019

# Objective
Goal: To try to achieve a more efficient mating between ylic133 and yEK7a, because the [previous attempt](./2019-08-07-Exp-crossing-yEK7a-and-ylic133_1.md) did not get good results after sporulation.

# Method
- Grow an overnight culture of each of the strains in 10mL YPD
- Next morning take a YPD agar plate and add 20ul of each dense liquid culture one on top of each other.
- Microscopy time lapse imaging of the mixture of both strains 100ul of 150X yEK7a (highly dense) and ylic133_5 (no dense at all) no diluted , after being washed in non fluorescence media (CSM).

# Results
- There are "weird structures" on the ylic133_5 well, flowers like structures.  It could be some sort of contamination, but which type?

- Jut one cell appear to show this dumbell shape (top left last frames) :(

- As a next step , I will image all my glycerol stocks from ylic133 and ylic132
# Conclusion
