# Title: 03102019- III pBK549 transformation on ylic133 for further sanity check in SATAY

# Date
03102019-

# Objective
To ensure that the constructed strain is able to pass the Satay sanity check, and then I can continue with the further steps, like mating with yEK7a.

# Method
- @14:00 Incubation form glycerol stocks of ylic133_1, ylic133_4,ylic133_5 and Byk832 in new YPD+6xADE media.
- New pBK549 plasmid extraction from bacteria. Miniprep and enzyme restriction assay in the same day of transformation. Look [here for the restriction protocol](../2019-07/2019-07-04_Exp_pBK549_digestion_plasmid.md)
