# Title : 01102019- II pBK549 transformation on ylic133 for further sanity check in SATAY :pensive:

# Date
01102019-03102019

# Objective
To ensure that the constructed strain is able to pass the Satay sanity check, and then I can continue with the further steps, like mating with yEK7a.

# Method
- 30092019 -Incubation of single colonies from the plates from 24092019 and Byk832 as positive control from glycerol stock @10:30.
- 01102019 - OD measurements @9:35

|   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Dilution factor to OD=0.5   |Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ylic133_1  |1.214  | 12.14  | 24  | @9:35 |
| ylic133_4   |1.216   |12.16  | 24  | @9:35 |
| ylic133_5 |0.316   | 3.16  | 6 | @9:35 |
| Byk832  |0.308 | 3.08  | 6  | @9:35 |

  - @9:55 Incubation at OD~= 0.5 to OD~=2 in YP+6x ADE


  |   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Ready to transform |Time|
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | ylic133_1  |0.121  | 1.21  | close to OD=2  | @13:15 |
  | ylic133_4   |0.118   |1.18  | close to OD=2   | @13:15 |
  | ylic133_5 |0.233   | 2.33  | yes | @13:15 |
  | Byk832  |0.290 | 2.9  | yes  | @13:15 |
  - @14:30 30C incubation
  - 100ng of pBk549
  - **Notes on the procedure** :
    - I did not vortex the cells with the transformation mix, instead I pippeted in and out after each ingredients, by this way I avoided clumps formation that hinder transformation efficiency.
    - I did not use the maximum speed (13300) of the centrifuge to get rid of the LiAc, instead I used 8000rpm.
    - I heated the ssDNA to 95C and then transfered to ice before  I added the 0.1M LiAc , so I could do all steps of LiAc washing and samples separation consecutively.
  - I plated all (200ul) in the selection plates (-URA+6x ADE), both, negative control and transformed cells.
# Results
- 031022019 No clonies in the selection plates :pensive: I just see 3 colonies in ylic133_1 plate.
  - Possible causes:

    - The plasmid is degraded
        - **check**: I loaded 10ul of plasmid into a gel to see If I have low bands, that could indicate degradation of the plasmid.
         ![](../images/03102019-pBK549-plasmid-gel.png)
        - **This result implies that plasmid degradation IS NOT THE CAUSE**.
    - The plasmid was lost
        - **check**: I restreak one colony I had on the selection plate into a new -URA+6xade plate to see if they actually acquired the plasmid:
          ![](../images/03102019-one-colony-testing-ylic133+pbk549-to-discard-plasmid-problems.png)
          - This implies that is **neither the cause**.
    - I used an extremely low amount of plasmid
      - This could be due that I did not vortex the plasmid before using it, and maybe some of it sediment to the bottom, and effectively I took less plasmid than what I thought. Next time I should vortex it anyways.
    - The selection plates are not good i.e. nothing can grow there.
      - **check**: I plated a positive control (yWKD017 and ylic132) on the -ura plate+6x Ade I used for the selection plate.
        ![](../images/-ura+6xade-03092019-check-positive-control.png)
      - This growth of positive control on the plate indicates that **the plates ARE NOT THE CAUSE**
    - My reagents of the transformation protocol are not good.
      - Maybe my PEG50% is not well... If the next transformation does not work , I will replace all my reagents for new fresh ones.
      - I actually replace the LiAc , I did a new 1M stock of 50mL.


# Conclusion
- Still I dont know the cause of why my transformation arent working, though I discarded multiple causes.
- I will try again with new plasmid from another bacteria incubation, and after checking that my plates are indeed correct, to discard those factors.
