# Title: 03102019- III pBK549 transformation on ylic133 for further sanity check in SATAY :blush: :punch:

# Date
03102019-09102019

# Objective
To ensure that the constructed strain is able to pass the Satay sanity check, and then I can continue with the further steps, like mating with yEK7a.

# Method
- 14:00 Incubation form glycerol stocks of ylic133_1, ylic133_4,ylic133_5 and Byk832 in new YPD+6xADE media.
- New pBK549 plasmid extraction from bacteria. Miniprep and enzyme restriction assay in the same day of transformation. Look [here for the restriction protocol](../2019-07/2019-07-04_Exp_pBK549_digestion_plasmid.md)
- 04102019 9:15 OD measurements

|   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Dilution factor to OD=0.5   |Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ylic133_1  |0.368  | 3.68  | 7.76X  | 9:15 |
| ylic133_5 |0.478  | 4.78  | 9.56X | 9:15 |
| Byk832  |0.057| 0.57  | 1,14X  | 9:15 |
- Miniprep to extract pBK549
  - concentration: 46,7 ng/ul total volume 240 uL
  - Digestion testing by EcoRv, PvuII and both:

- 13:00 OD measurements 10x dilution

|   | OD-10X dilution |Titer   |Ready to transform   |Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ylic133_1  |0.255  | 2.5  | Yes  | 9:15 |
| ylic133_5 |0.198  | 1.98  | Yes | 9:15 |
| Byk832  |0.385| 3.8  | Yes  | 9:15 |

- 3ul plasmid (46,7ng/ul) implies 140ng plasmid.
- I prepare another stock of 1M of LiAc.
- Plating 150ul cells+50ul MiliQ and 30ul cells+170ul MiliQ in -URA+6xADE and 20ul cells +180ul MiliQ in YPD (positive control)
# Results :smile:

# Conclusion
- 09102019 This time the transformation really works , giving plenty of colonies in all the strains. I suspected that what made the big difference is the change of the LiAc.
- The negative control is good, so there is no growth in any of the plates.

# Next steps
- Sanity check in -ade and -ura plates .
