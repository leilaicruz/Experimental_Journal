# Title : 17062020 Experimental Plan to accomplish 2020 experimental goals.

## Date
17062020

## Objective
- To elaborate a realistic plan to continue doing experiments. 

## Method
- Look at the agreed plan from the yearly meeting. 
- Draw scenarios/ possibilities due to currently crisis of covid-19. 

### Agreed plan

1. Measure the essential genes in each of the genetic backgrounds of the trajectory. 

### Scenarios to achieve that plan

- Scenario 1: *Ideal*
    - **Overlap with Enzo and Wessel experiments**
        - Enzo and Wessel do the SATAY on $\Delta bem1$ and $\Delta bem1\Delta bem3$
        - Enzo will do the SATAY of $\Delta bem1\Delta bem3\Delta nrp1\Delta bem2$ 
    - I will do the SATAY and strain construction of $\Delta bem1\Delta bem3\Delta nrp1$ 

- Scenario 2: *Probable*
    - **Overlap with Enzo and Wessel experiments**
        - Enzo and Wessel do the SATAY on $\Delta bem1$.
        - Enzo will do the SATAY of $\Delta bem1\Delta bem3\Delta nrp1\Delta bem2$ 
        - I will do the SATAY and strain construction of $\Delta bem1\Delta bem3\Delta nrp1$ and for $\Delta bem1\Delta bem3$.


### Consequences for each scenario

- Scenario *Ideal* :

    - Develop a plan for the strain construction (knockout the ade2 gene in ylic128)(~ 2 months). It can start in September 2020. 
    - Do the SATAY on all strains (~ ? months)
- Scenario *Probable* :
    - Develop a plan to have $\Delta bem1\Delta bem3 $ *ura3-* *ade2-*.(~ 3 months) It can start in September 2020. 
    - Develop a plan for the strain construction (knockout the ade2 gene in ylic128)(~ 2 months). It can start in September 2020. 
    - Do SATAY on all strains.
