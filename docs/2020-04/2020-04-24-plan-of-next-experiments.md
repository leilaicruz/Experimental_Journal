# Title: 24042020-Plan for next experiments 

## Date: 
24042020

## Potential Plan [^1]:

[^1]: We are living in difficult times due to the coronavirus crisis. One of the measurements is to work as much as possible from home. Hence any experimental plan now is not to be taken so serious :D  

- [ ] Repeat the biotek measurements using the wt strain in order to compare these mutants relative to the WT. 
- [ ] Make a PCR from inside the leu2 marker and bem2 to check the correct integration of bem2::leu2 transformants. (colony PCR or genomic) **still is not clear the differences I see in the selected biological replicates for bem2::leu2 mutants**
