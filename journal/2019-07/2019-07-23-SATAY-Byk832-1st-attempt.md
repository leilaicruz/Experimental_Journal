# Title: 29072019-SATAY 1st attempt with Byk832-T :pray:

# Date
Tuesday, 29072019 -

# Objective
To learn about the whole technique and detect the main issues and bottlenecks when used it for the target strain.

# Method

1. Streak the chosen Byk832 transformed cells that display full growth in -URA and medium growth in -ade, in -ura.
2. **Pre-culture step** - 29072019

    - Scrape cells from SD-URA, inoculate **20-30mL** SD-URA 0.2% glucose +2% Raffinose at OD600=0.16-0.24 (OD=0.06 works as well)
        > it is more than one cell, just take with a pipette tip many cells and put them in a eppi with 1ml MiliQ

        > Measure the OD of a 100x diluted stock (10ul of diluted cells + 990ml MiliQ)

           | Strain  | OD (100x diluted) |
           |---|---|
           |Byk832T_1   | 0.15 |
           |Byk832T_2   | 0.24 |
           |Byk832T_3   | 0.20 |

        > Dilution to OD=0,2 to a final volume of 20mL

        > Enzo did three flasks more , as technical replicates.

    - Incubate at 30C, 140-160 rpm, to OD=4-6 (around 20h)
        > Started at :clock230: (14:30) :blush:
    - It is recommended to start with 3-4 precultures and later chose which to reseed in SD-ADE 2% Glucose.
    #### Benoit Data

    |   | OD start |  OD stop |  Time  |
    | strain # 1 | 0.234  | 4.33  |  20h |
    | strain # 2  | 0.233  | 4.02  | 20h  |
    | strain # 3  | 0.235 |  3.85 | 20h  |
    | strain # 4  | 0.227  | 4.04  | 20h  |
    | strain # 5  | 0.229 | 3.94  |  20h |
    | strain # 6  | 0.235  | 4.07  | 20h  |
    #### Our data
    | Strain  | Preculture  |   |   |  |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    |   | OD start (25072019-14:15pm) |  OD stop |  Time  | Technical replicate (2)|
    | Byk832T_1  | 0.2396  |   |   | Enzo |
    | Byk832T_2  | 0.1912  |   |   | Enzo |
    | Byk832T_3  | 0.3153  |   |   | Enzo |
    | Byk832T_1  | 0.19  |   |   | Leila |
    | Byk832T_2  | 0.14  |   |   | Leila |
    | Byk832T_3  | 0.17  |   |   | Leila |

3. **Induction**

    - Inoculate **200ml SD-URA 2% Galactose at OD600=0.2** from the saturated preculture.
    - Incubate at 30C , 140 to 160 rpm for **50-52 hours**
    - To evaluate the background:

        - Spread 200ul of this inoculum on SD-ADE
        - Dilute the inoculum 1000x, spread 200ul on SD-URA and SD complete
            - score after 2 days:
            - [ ] Expect ~200-400 ADE+ clones/mL culture, i.e. ~0.01%-0.02% of the total number of cells.
                *These are cells that repaired the ADE2 gene by homologous recombination WITHOUT transposition*
    - The OD should have reached 4-5 after 20h of induction.
