# Title: 29072019-SATAY 1st attempt with Byk832-T :pray: :confused: :x:

## Date
Tuesday, 29072019 - 31072019

## Objective
To learn about the whole technique and detect the main issues and bottlenecks when used it for the target strain.

## Method

1. Streak the chosen Byk832 transformed cells that display full growth in -URA and medium growth in -ade, in -ura.
2. **Pre-culture step** - 29072019 :clock230: (14:30) :blush:

    - Scrape cells from SD-URA, inoculate **20-30mL** SD-URA 0.2% glucose +2% Raffinose at OD600=0.16-0.24 (OD=0.06 works as well)
        > it is more than one cell, just take with a pipette tip many cells and put them in a eppi with 1ml MiliQ

        > Measure the OD of a 100x diluted stock (10ul of diluted cells + 990ml MiliQ)

           | Strain  | OD (100x diluted) |
           |---|---|
           |Byk832T_1   | 0.15 |
           |Byk832T_2   | 0.24 |
           |Byk832T_3   | 0.20 |

        > Dilution to OD=0,2 to a final volume of 20mL

        > Enzo did three flasks more , as technical replicates.

    - Incubate at 30C, 140-160 rpm, to OD=4-6 (around 20h)
        > Started at :clock230: (14:30) :blush:
    - It is recommended to start with 3-4 precultures and later chose which to reseed in SD-ADE 2% Glucose.

    #### Benoit Data

| Strain  |  OD start  | OD STOP | Time  |
|---|---|---|---|
| strain # 3  | 0.235 |  3.85 | 20h  |
| strain # 5  | 0.229 | 3.94  |  20h |
| strain # 2  | 0.233  | 4.02  | 20h  |
| strain # 4  | 0.227  | 4.04  | 20h  |
| strain # 6  | 0.235  | 4.07  | 20h  |
| strain # 1 | 0.234  | 4.33  |  20h |

 
#### Our data

| Strain (2 technical replicates) | Preculture  |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|   | OD start (29072019-:clock230: -> 14:30) |  OD stop (**~2X higher<br> than Benoit data**) |  Time  |
| Byk832T_1(Leila) | 0.19  | ~ 12.6  | 19h  |
| Byk832T_2 (Leila) | 0.14  | ~11.2  | 19h  |
| Byk832T_3(Leila)  | 0.17  | ~ 10.8   | 19h  |
| Byk832T_1(Enzo)  | 0.19  | ~ 8   | 19h  |
| Byk832T_2(Enzo)  | 0.14  | ~ 10   | 19h  |
| Byk832T_3(Enzo)  | 0.17  | ~ 9.7   | 19h  |

3. **Induction**

    - Inoculate **200ml SD-URA 2% Galactose at OD600=0.2** from the saturated preculture.
       > We choose base on the OD values Byk832T_1(Enzo),Byk832T_2(Enzo), Byk832T_3(Enzo), and Byk832T_3(Leila) forthe induction in **150mL of media**
    - Incubate at 30C , 140 to 160 rpm for **50-52 hours**
       > 30072019-:clock1030: -> 10:30 start T=0 of induction.
    - **To evaluate the background**:

        - [x] Spread 200ul of this inoculum on SD-ADE
        - [x] Dilute the inoculum 1000x, spread 200ul on SD-URA and SD complete
            - score after 2 days:
            - [x] :pensive: Expect ~200-400 ADE+ clones/mL culture (~ 40-80 clones for 200ul), i.e. ~0.01%-0.02% of the total number of cells.
                *These are cells that repaired the ADE2 gene by homologous recombination WITHOUT transposition*

                > The plates next morning had easily more than 200 colonies , which means 5 times more than indicated for Benoit.

                ![](../Images/Byk832T-1-3--ade-200ul-culture.png)
    - Reproduce the following plots, with the chosen technical replicates for induction:
    ![](../Images/satay-benoit-induction-plots.png)

          - Step 1: At the time of induction we plate 200ul from the induction culture at OD=0.2
     > We could not plate at T=0 from the induction culture, because we did not have enough plates.

          - Step 2: Next day morning  repeat Step 1 (17 hours)

      > 31072019 - **We aborted this attempt because of a high background**

          - Step 3: 3 hours later  repeat Step 1  (20 hours)
          - Step 4: Next morning  repeat Step 1 (42 hours)
          - Step 5: Same day afternoon , repeat Step 1 (51 hours)
          - Step 6-8 : Every morning Step 1, for 5 days more.

    - **The OD should have reached 4-5 after 20h of induction**.

      > Measure OD , next day after induction.

    - In order to know how well the transposition is going before reseeding:

        - Spread 200ul directly on SD-ADE
        - Spread 200ul of a 40000X dilution on SD and on SD-URA
        - Score under a binocular after 30h (i.e. closer to the time of reseed)
        - Expect around 0.05-0.1% of the cells to have become ADE+ . Incubate the plate for one more day for a final count.
        - **Pursue with the culture that gives the highest number of clones, starting from a minimum of background.**
        - *500-1000X more ADE+ clones at T=51 hours than at T=0 of inductions is in the ballpark*

4. **Reseed**

- Determine the number of ADE+ clones after 50-52 hours of induction. **If you have around 2.35E5 ADE+ cells per mL is GREAT**.
- Inoculate 14E6 cells (14 million of cells) in SD-ADE 2% glucose at OD=0.2 in 2-4L
- Incubate at 30C, 140 rpm, harvest at OD~2 (80 hours). Note that the final OD will not exceed the value of 2.
- *Fo reasons we ignore, the presence of ade- cells in the mix inhibits the growth of ade+ cells. This is why the culture will not grow above OD=2. This is also why you should not reinoculate at an OD above 0.2*
- To estimate the growth of ADE+ cells: dilute the culture 2000X, spread 200 ul on SD-ADE – dilute 40000X, spread 200 ul on SD and SD-URA – Expect  the number of ADE+ cells to have been multiplied by ~1000X.

Note1: If you don’t mind increasing the volume, you can reseed at a lower OD, and thus have less growth inhibition. But in any case you want to inoculate enough cells so as to keep a good complexity in your library.

  - For example, a library containing 1.8E5 ADE+ cells/ml  (OD=7.27, 0.15% ADE+ cells) after induction and reseeded at OD0.2 in 2L (1E7 independent transpositions) will reach an OD of 2 and a fold increase of 1250

 – the same library reseeded at OD0.1 in 2L (5E6 independent transpositions)  will reach OD3 for a fold increase of 3700

5. **Harvest cells and proceed to DNA extraction as in published protocol**.

Because of the growth inhibition, only ~70% of the harvested cells are ADE+, meaning that during the sequencing reaction, 30% of the reads will map to the untransposed transposon in ADE2.
