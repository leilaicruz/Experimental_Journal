# Title: 09102019- Sanity check of transformants ylic133+pBk549, Byk832+pBk549 to know if they suitable for SATAY. :smile:

# Date
09102019-11102019

# Objective

To investigate the suitability of my engineered yeast strain ylic133 to use it for SATAY.

# Method
- 09102019 Re-streaking each single colony from the transformation plate into -URA+6x ade and -ADE plate.
- 09102019 I restreak 16 colonies from ylic133_5 and 8 for ylic133_1 and 8 for Byk832T

# Results :D
-11102019 - I could see some cells from ylic133_5+pBK549 and Byk832+pBK549 that depict the desired pattern to pass the sanity check i.e. few growth in -ade and fully growth in -ura.

- One interesting observation is that the cells restreaked in -ade became pink in the ylic133_5 plate and some of them also for the case of Byk832T. The few that spontaneously recombined are not pink (they repaired the adenine) but the ones in the beginning where the pipette tip has the most amount of cells, they became pink.

# Conclusion
- Fortunately, my clones of ylic133_5 are good to do SATAY :)
- The next steps are then transforming this strain (ylic133_5) with pLL112 to be able to cross it with yEk7a and select for all the useful phenotypes , then transform each of them with the pBK549 plasmid (after returning from Cuba :earth_americas: :sun_with_face:).
