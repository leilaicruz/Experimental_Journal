# Title : gDNA extraction from yWT04a 

## Date

27112020

## Objective

- To have the DNA template bem3$\Delta$::NAT to make the PCR for transformation on ylic133 and ylic136.

## Method

- Genomic extraction Kit with the Roboclon KIT.
- Pellet from 2mL of culture in each eppi. I had 6 eppies. 
- 30uL of elution.
- concentration from the Nanodrop: 36ng/uL , much higher than before because of the activation of the column with Buffer BG that previously I was overlooking. 

### PCR

- 1ul of the DNA from ywt04a and yll3a reference 
- Primers 51/52 and oLL401/402
- 60C annealing temperature and 2mins 72C extension. 
- Gel 120V, 30 mins. 5ul loaded
