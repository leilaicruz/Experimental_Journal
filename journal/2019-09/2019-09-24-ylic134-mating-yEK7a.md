<font color='black'>

# Date
24092019-

# Objective

 To get a diploid that I am able to select for with marker selection.

# Method
- 23092019: Incubation of single colonies and not multiple colonies (from the transformation plate) of ylic134 in CSM-URA , and yEk7a from glycerol stock.
- 24092019: Clear tubes :( , no growth of the colonies taken of  ylic134 (maybe it is because ylic133_3 still grows very slowly)
  - I took more colonies from the transformation plate and transfer them grow in CSM-URA
  - I did replica plating of the transformation plate onto a another -ura plate , to check the viability of the transformants on -ura.
# Results
